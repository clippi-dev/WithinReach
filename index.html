  <p>The first time I went sailing on the San Francisco Bay was with Jim McGihon.  Jim was my boss at GE Capital Genstar Container Corporation.  I was hooked from that first Friday afternoon where we cut out of work early.  
  
  The things I enjoyed were:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>All you think about is which way the wind is blowing</li>
    <li>It's technical with infinite ability to learn</li>
    <li>Never done learning</li>
    <li>Scenic</li>
    <li>Relaxing</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>It was a short excursion, leaving from Sausilito, CA in the early afternoon.  As I recall, we only sailed to the Golden Gate Bridge and back, but I was hooked.</p>
